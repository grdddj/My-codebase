# TicTacToe in OutputWindow
I barely know if statements, creating chess is quite complicated - what about giving TicTacToe a try?
My first own application ever, before I even knew what GUI is. So why not creating a game in output window. Fully functional, for two players, supporting multiple board sizes, with automatic resolution of the winner. Just prepare to type letters and numbers into the console, instead of choosing your next move by a mouse :)
