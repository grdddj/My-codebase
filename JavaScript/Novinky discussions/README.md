# Novinky discussions
This project is aggregating comments from discussions within arbitrary Novinky.cz news site, and is sorting them according the number of votes (the best ones, the worst ones etc.)

It is calling REST API written in Flask, which handles the request and delivers the response with all the comments in desired sorting.
