# Chess robot

Do you also like chess, and do you also hate cheaters? However, it can be beneficial to get experience with cheating techniques, at least just to spot them easily when they are being employed against you.

This project is creating a chess robot that is performing moves on a "physical screen" chessboard, as a response to opponents moves.
