# Shortcuts to shortcuts
Tired of shortcuts, so your natural left-hand position is with little-finger on Ctrl and index-finger on C or V? Make your life easier and replace repetitive shortcuts just by one key!

This project is focusing on creating user-friendly GUI where users can choose from various actions to be triggered just by pressing one key - I chose right Control as the magic key.

It only starts at replicating keyboard shortcuts - the possibilities of connecting any python function with one key-press are really fantastic in my opinion!

The code is easily extendable, as everybody can just write their own function, bind it to a specific key, and the GUI will automatically generate all necessary buttons - no need to be a UI designer for this :)
