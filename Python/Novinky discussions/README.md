# Novinky discussions
Who would like to go through all the discussion comments and identifying the most fun ones, or the baddest ones? I do not like doing that manually. Therefore I created this application...

Because of Novinky.cz changing their comments architecture literally 3 days after I made this, the new version with Selenium had to be created. This version is however unusable as an API, as Selenium is very, very slow, and waiting 20 seconds for a response is not the best UX.
