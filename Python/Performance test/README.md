# Python performance testing
This small project is dedicated to Radek, because he challenged me for a
speed competition of our favorite programming languages (his C# and my Python).

I am almost sure I am going to lose in a head-to-head speed competition on
RUNTIME, just from the nature of the both languages (compiled vs. interpreted).

I certainly admit the use-cases and advantages of C# and it's peers, but I do not
think that the running speed at RUNTIME is the main parameter most of the time.
On the contrary, I would say that it just matters less and less, as the computers
are getting more powerful and almost everything (yes, even Python) is a lightning quick
looking at absolute values. Meaning that for the most applications (from the user perspective),
it is not crucial difference, if the requests takes 0,01 second to process, or only 0,001
(not always, but majority of the time).

What I would like to point out is the easiness with which Python scripts can be
written and understood by almost anyone. The one and only one script located in this folder is
in direct opposition with the bunch of files needed to run the C# version.
There is also no necessity at all for some IDE or some other programs necessary
to handle all the compilation and other stuff connected with the C# development.
On the other hand to write a working script or application in Python, all you
need to do is one program (like Anaconda) and simple notepad to write the code -
it means ready to code in minutes, the simple scripts written almost immediately.
(Just to state, I have no experience with C# development, so maybe I am wrong in
judging it as unnecessary demanding and complicated, but in my limited knowledge
the development process cannot be compared with the Python, from
the user-friendliness and speed point of view.)

To sum the benefits of this "challenge" for me, I realized that programming
languages just cannot be compared according to some specific task (like counting
the words in a text file and measuring time), because this is just a very small
part of the story. Each language has it's own pros and cons, and the speed
of execution, however important it can be, is not always the only factor to
consider.

Oh, I almost forgot to share the results I got (as they are secondary here):
I made a 2,8 MB txt file with Lorem Ipsum content (yeah, a little bit of cheating),
and it was averagely processed in 0,4 seconds, with all the file loadings and
saving the results into a new file (not printing it to the console, which is rather
useless, and also much slower than writing to a file).

Radek, I did not try your version yet (also because of the complexity of the C# app
running, which I have no idea of, and have little time to study it now). After
you come back from the Country of unlimited opportunities, I would be more than
happy to try it with your instructions, and we can have some more coding challenges, to benefit
our knowledge and overview.
