# Ultimate PDF highlighter

Do you also like colours, especially when highlighting new interesting information? It is very handy to do it in PDFs. However, it can take some time and effort - why not make it more user-friendly and connect it with other useful features!

This project focuses on highlighting text in PDF and copying them into a clipboard. There are more possibilities how to achieve it, so I am mixing two possible user inputs (clicking middle mouse or pressing right Control key) and two ways how to highlight in PDF (clicking on highlighter icon or right-clicking and pressing "Z").

These scripts go very well together with clipboard monitoring script, and in combination they offer ultimate user experience when working with PDF documents.

Working on a diploma thesis was never simpler!

PS: I would be already finished with my thesis if I concentrated more on writing it than on creating these scripts. (But it's so much fun!)
