# Website alarm
Are you waiting to buy some rare goods in e-shop, but don't want to be present all the time in front of the screen, manually pressing F5?

You can just max out your volume, start a script, and relax in a sofa or anywhere else. When the goods will come to stock, you will hear a loud alarm and can buy it immediately.
